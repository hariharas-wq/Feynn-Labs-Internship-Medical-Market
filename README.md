# MEDICAL MARKET SEGMENTATION
In the given Report We are mainly focused on innovation in health technology and development processes in healthcare industries. We analyze the Medical Market in India with respect to Geographic, Demographic, psychographic, Behavioral pattern and finally we come up with a feasible strategy to enter in the biotech market. To accomplish this, this work explores the prediction of Blood Pressure, Diabetes, Vitamin Deficiency by taking various attributes related to disease. For this purpose, we use the Different Dataset, we apply a K-means clustering) Machine Learning classification and ensemble Techniques to predict results. Machine Learning Is a method that is used to train computers or machines explicitly. Be used the K-Means algorithm because it gives better results according to another algorithm. Thus, for this purpose, we apply popular classification and ensemble methods to a dataset for prediction.
